# E_commerce Sales Dashboard  

# Summary  

The dashboard reveals that overall e-commerce performance 
is strong with a total sales amount of 9.68M, driven mainly 
by high-performing states like California and New York, 
while profitability remains relatively low with a profit 
margin of 2.56%.    

● Sales are highest during the end of the year and gradually 
decline toward the beginning of the next year, and categories 
such as Technology and Office Supplies contribute the 
most to total revenue, whereas sub-categories like Copiers 
and Phones show the strongest profit levels.     

# Insights and Findings   

a) California is the highest revenue-generating state:   
California contributes the largest share of total sales compared to 
all  other states.          
This indicates strong market potential and customer demand in that 
region.    

b) Profit Margin is low at only 2.56%:  

● Despite high sales (9.68M), the overall profit margin 
remains low. 
● Low profitability reduces long-term sustainability and may 
indicate high costs or poor pricing strategy. 
● Review product pricing, reduce operational costs, optimize 
discount strategies, and focus on higher-margin products.   

c) Technology and Office Supplies lead in total sales:   

These categories generate the highest revenue among all product 
segments.  
Identifying top-performing categories helps prioritize stock 
planning and marketing.  
Expand these product lines, introduce bundle offers, and invest 
in category-specific promotions.      

d)  Sub-categories like Copiers and Phones show strong profit 
performance:   

These sub-categories generate higher profit compared to others. 
High-profit items are essential for improving overall profit 
margins. 
Promote these items more aggressively, improve visibility on the 
store, and explore upselling opportunities.   

e) Monthly sales trend shows decline from December to 
February:  

Sales drop consistently at the start of the year. 
Seasonal dips affect cash flow and resource planning. 
Launch New Year promotional campaigns, apply seasonal 
discounts, and offer loyalty rewards to stabilize early-year 
demand.  

f) Year-wise analysis shows fluctuating profit margin despite 
rising sales:  

Sales increase in later years, but profit margin shows 
inconsistent growth. 
Increasing revenue without improving profitability is not 
sustainable. 
Re-evaluate cost structure, focus on high-margin categories, and 
optimize logistics and operations.
